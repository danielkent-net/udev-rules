# Random Collection of Useful udev Rules

[udev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev) is a daemon that manages the enumeration and initialization of hardware on Linux-based systems. It is an extraordinarily powerful and flexible, however learning how to write rules is somewhat akin to sorcery.

Over the years, I've occasionally written rules to solve problems and make my life easier. I am providing some of them here in the hopes they are useful to others.
